# Player Management Implementation - CATAN

## Overview

This implementation provides a comprehensive player management system for the CATAN board game that supports all requirements specified in the gameplan.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

### 1. Player Class Enhancement (`Player.java`)

#### **Support for 3-4 Players with Unique Names and Colors**

- `PlayerColor` enum with 4 predefined colors: RED, BLUE, ORANGE, WHITE
- Unique player ID system (0-3)
- Name validation to prevent duplicates
- Color validation to prevent duplicates

#### **Resource Inventory System**

- `ResourceType` enum for the 5 resource types: WOOD, CLAY, GRAIN, WOOL, ORE
- HashMap-based resource inventory for efficient storage and retrieval
- Methods for adding/removing resources with validation
- Resource cost checking and payment system
- Total resource card counting

#### **Building Inventory Management**

- Tracks available buildings: 15 roads, 5 settlements, 4 cities per player
- Tracks placed buildings for victory point calculation
- Building cost validation (resources + availability)
- Automatic resource deduction when building

#### **Victory Point Calculation and Tracking**

- Automatic calculation: 1 VP per settlement, 2 VP per city
- Support for additional victory points (e.g., longest road)
- Win condition checking (10+ victory points)
- Real-time victory point updates

#### **Turn Order Management**

- Turn order assignment and tracking
- Active player state management
- Turn start/end methods

### 2. Player Manager Class (`PlayerManager.java`)

#### **Game Setup and Validation**

- Support for 3-4 players (configurable min/max)
- Unique name and color validation
- Random turn order generation
- Game state management (before/after start)

#### **Turn Management**

- Current player tracking
- Turn progression with automatic state updates
- Active player management

#### **Player Queries and Statistics**

- Player lookup by ID or name
- Players sorted by turn order or victory points
- Winner detection
- Game statistics collection

## üéØ Key Features Demonstrated

### Resource Management

```java
// Adding resources
player.addResource(ResourceType.WOOD, 3);

// Checking if player can afford something
Map<ResourceType, Integer> roadCost = Map.of(
    ResourceType.WOOD, 1,
    ResourceType.CLAY, 1
);
boolean canAfford = player.canAfford(roadCost);

// Paying for buildings
boolean success = player.payResources(roadCost);
```

### Building System

```java
// Building with automatic resource deduction
if (player.canBuildRoad()) {
    player.buildRoad(); // Automatically deducts 1 Wood + 1 Clay
}

if (player.canBuildSettlement()) {
    player.buildSettlement(); // Automatically deducts 1 Wood + 1 Clay + 1 Grain + 1 Wool
}

if (player.canBuildCity()) {
    player.buildCity(); // Automatically deducts 2 Grain + 3 Ore
}
```

### Game Management

```java
PlayerManager manager = new PlayerManager();

// Adding players with validation
manager.addPlayer("Alice", PlayerColor.RED);
manager.addPlayer("Bob", PlayerColor.BLUE);

// Starting game
manager.startGame(); // Randomizes turn order

// Turn management
Player currentPlayer = manager.getCurrentPlayer();
Player nextPlayer = manager.nextTurn();

// Win detection
Player winner = manager.getWinner();
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights

### **Type Safety**

- Enums for resource types and player colors
- Strong typing prevents invalid operations

### **Validation and Error Handling**

- Comprehensive input validation
- Meaningful error messages
- Graceful failure handling

### **Extensibility**

- Easy to add new resource types or player colors
- Modular design supports future features
- Clear separation of concerns

### **Performance**

- HashMap for O(1) resource lookups
- Efficient collection operations
- Minimal memory overhead

## üß™ Testing

The implementation includes a comprehensive test class (`PlayerTest.java`) that demonstrates:

1. **PlayerManager functionality**
   - Adding players with validation
   - Duplicate name/color rejection
   - Game start and turn management
   - Turn order randomization

2. **Player functionality**
   - Resource management operations
   - Building construction and costs
   - Victory point calculation
   - Win condition detection

### Test Results

All tests pass successfully, demonstrating:

- ‚úÖ Proper resource management
- ‚úÖ Correct building costs and inventory tracking
- ‚úÖ Accurate victory point calculation
- ‚úÖ Valid turn management
- ‚úÖ Robust error handling

## üéÆ Game Rules Compliance

The implementation strictly follows 1995 CATAN rules:

### Building Costs

- **Road**: 1 Wood + 1 Clay
- **Settlement**: 1 Wood + 1 Clay + 1 Grain + 1 Wool (awards 1 VP)
- **City**: 2 Grain + 3 Ore (awards 2 VP total, replaces settlement)

### Building Limits

- **Roads**: 15 per player
- **Settlements**: 5 per player
- **Cities**: 4 per player

### Victory Conditions

- **Target**: 10 victory points
- **Sources**: Settlements (1 VP), Cities (2 VP), Special achievements

## üîÑ Integration Ready

This player management system is designed to integrate seamlessly with:

- Game board system (for building placement)
- Dice and resource production system
- Robber mechanics
- Trading system
- UI components

The clean API and comprehensive functionality provide a solid foundation for the complete CATAN implementation.
