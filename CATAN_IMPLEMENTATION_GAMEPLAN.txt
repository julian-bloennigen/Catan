6. **Victory Conditions** - 10-point win condition with proper tracking
7. **Game Flow Management** - Turn-based system with state management
8. **Testing Infrastructure** - Automated test suites for core systems

### ❌ Not Implemented (Critical Missing Features):
1. **Player Setup Interface** - Currently uses hardcoded test players only
2. **Building Placement UI** - Backend logic complete but no click-to-place interaction
3. **Complete Game Initialization** - No player name/color selection UI
4. **Trading System** - Button exists but no functionality implemented

### ⚠️ Partially Implemented:
1. **Start Screen** - Structure exists but lacks player setup functionality
2. **Settings Screen** - Basic structure with placeholder content only

### 🎯 Ready for Next Development Phase:
The game has a solid backend foundation with all core mechanics working properly. However, there are **critical missing UI components** that make the game not fully playable:

**CRITICAL PRIORITY ITEMS:**
1. **Player Setup UI** - Must implement name and color selection interface
2. **Building Placement UI** - Click-to-place functionality for roads, settlements, cities
3. **Complete Game Initialization** - Replace hardcoded test players with proper setup

**Current State:** Game mechanics work perfectly, but user interaction is severely limited without proper UI integration.

## Recent Achievements:
- **July 12, 2025**: Comprehensive dice roll system testing completed
- All 50+ test dice rolls passed validation
- Robber activation and movement verified across multiple players
- Resource production system validated for all dice values (2-12)
- Turn management tested through multiple complete rounds
- JavaFX application successfully running with real-time UI updates
