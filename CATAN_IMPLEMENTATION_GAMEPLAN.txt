# CATAN IMPLEMENTATION GAMEPLAN

## Project Overview
JavaFX application implementing the 1995 version of CATAN board game with all core rules, designed to be maintainable, extensible, and user-friendly.

## Technical Requirements
- **Language**: Java (English codebase)
- **Framework**: JavaFX
- **Module System**: Modular Java project with module-info.java
- **UI Language**: German or English
- **Documentation**: German or English
- **Target**: 3-4 player local game

## Core Functions to Implement

### 1. Game Board System
- **Hexagonal Field Generation**
  - 19 hexagonal fields with terrain types:
    - Forest (Wood production)
    - Pasture (Wool production) 
    - Fields (Grain production)
    - Hills (Clay production)
    - Mountains (Ore production)
    - Desert (no production)
  - Assign dice numbers 2-12 (except desert)
  - Implement field adjacency system for nodes and edges

### 2. Player Management
- **Player Class Enhancement**
  - Support 3-4 players with unique names and colors
  - Resource inventory: Wood, Clay, Grain, Wool, Ore
  - Building inventory: Roads, Settlements, Cities
  - Victory point calculation and tracking
  - Turn order management

### 3. Dice and Resource Production
- **Dice Rolling System**
  - Two-dice roll (2-12 range)
  - Resource distribution based on dice result
  - Settlement: 1 resource per adjacent field
  - City: 2 resources per adjacent field
  - No production when robber blocks field

### 4. Robber Mechanics
- **Robber Placement and Movement**
  - Initial placement on desert field
  - Activate on dice roll of 7
  - Player-controlled movement to any field
  - Block resource production on occupied field
  - No resource cards stolen (simplified version)

### 5. Building System
- **Road Construction**
  - Cost: 1 Wood + 1 Clay
  - Must connect to existing roads or settlements
  - Validate adjacency rules
  
- **Settlement Construction**
  - Cost: 1 Wood + 1 Clay + 1 Grain + 1 Wool
  - Only on free nodes
  - Minimum 2-node distance from other settlements
  - Awards 1 victory point
  
- **City Upgrade**
  - Cost: 2 Grain + 3 Ore
  - Only on existing own settlements
  - Replace settlement with city
  - Awards 2 victory points (total, not additional)

### 6. Victory Conditions
- **Win Condition Tracking**
  - Target: 10 victory points
  - Points from settlements: 1 point each
  - Points from cities: 2 points each
  - Optional: Longest road (2 points for 5+ connected roads)
  - Immediate game end when 10 points reached

### 7. Game Flow Management
- **Turn-Based System**
  - Dice roll phase
  - Resource production phase
  - Building action phase
  - Turn transition
  - Game state validation

### 8. User Interface Design
- **Game Screen Components**
  - Hexagonal game board visualization
  - Player information panels
  - Resource counters
  - Building placement interface
  - Turn indicator
  - Victory point display
  
- **Start Screen**
  - Player setup (3-4 players)
  - Name and color selection
  - Game initialization
  
- **Settings Screen**
  - Game options
  - Display preferences

### 9. Game Initialization
- **Setup Phase**
  - Random board generation
  - Initial robber placement
  - Player order determination
  - Starting resources (if any)

### 10. Input Validation
- **Rule Enforcement**
  - Building placement validation
  - Resource requirement checking
  - Legal move verification
  - Turn action limitations

## Excluded Features (As Per Requirements)
- ❌ Development cards
- ❌ Special cards (Largest Army, etc.)
- ❌ Expansions (Cities & Knights, etc.)
- ❌ Network functionality
- ❌ AI opponents
- ❌ Animations, music, sound effects
- ❌ Resource card stealing from robber
- ❌ Maritime trade

## Optional Features
- ✅ Trading between players (simple implementation)
- ✅ Longest road calculation
- ⚠️ Square fields instead of hexagons (7-point penalty)

## Implementation Priority Order

### Phase 1: Core Structure
1. Game board representation (Hexagon, GameField)
2. Player class with resources and buildings
3. Basic UI framework (JavaFX screens)

### Phase 2: Game Mechanics
1. Dice rolling and resource production
2. Building placement system
3. Victory point calculation
4. Turn management

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Robber mechanics
2. Building rule validation
3. Game initialization and setup
4. Win condition detection

### Phase 4: Polish
1. UI improvements
2. Input validation
3. Error handling
4. Testing and debugging

## Technical Architecture
- **MVC Pattern**: Separate game logic from UI
- **Modular Design**: Each component in separate packages
- **Event-Driven**: UI responds to game state changes
- **Extensible**: Design allows for future feature additions

## Quality Assurance
- **Stability**: Robust error handling and input validation
- **Usability**: Intuitive interface design
- **Maintainability**: Clean code structure and documentation
- **Reliability**: Consistent game rule enforcement
