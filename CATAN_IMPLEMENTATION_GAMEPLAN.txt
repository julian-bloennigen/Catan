# CATAN IMPLEMENTATION GAMEPLAN

## Project Overview
JavaFX application implementing the 1995 version of CATAN board game with all core rules, designed to be maintainable, extensible, and user-friendly.

## Technical Requirements
- **Language**: Java (English codebase)
- **Framework**: JavaFX
- **Module System**: Modular Java project with module-info.java
- **UI Language**: German or English
- **Documentation**: German or English
- **Target**: 3-4 player local game

## Core Functions to Implement

### 1. Game Board System ✅ COMPLETED
- **Hexagonal Field Generation** ✅
  - ✅ 19 hexagonal fields with terrain types:
    - ✅ Forest (Wood production)
    - ✅ Pasture (Wool production) 
    - ✅ Fields (Grain production)
    - ✅ Hills (Clay production)
    - ✅ Mountains (Ore production)
    - ✅ Desert (no production)
  - ✅ Assign dice numbers 2-12 (except desert)
  - ✅ Implement field adjacency system for nodes and edges

### 2. Player Management ✅ COMPLETED
- **Player Class Enhancement** ✅
  - ✅ Support 3-4 players with unique names and colors
  - ✅ Resource inventory: Wood, Clay, Grain, Wool, Ore
  - ✅ Building inventory: Roads, Settlements, Cities
  - ✅ Victory point calculation and tracking
  - ✅ Turn order management

### 3. Dice and Resource Production ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- **Dice Rolling System** ⚠️
  - ⚠️ Two-dice roll (2-12 range) - Logic exists but needs UI integration
  - ✅ Resource distribution based on dice result
  - ✅ Settlement: 1 resource per adjacent field
  - ✅ City: 2 resources per adjacent field
  - ✅ No production when robber blocks field

### 4. Robber Mechanics ✅ COMPLETED
- **Robber Placement and Movement** ✅
  - ✅ Initial placement on desert field
  - ❌ Activate on dice roll of 7 - Needs UI integration
  - ✅ Player-controlled movement to any field
  - ✅ Block resource production on occupied field
  - ✅ No resource cards stolen (simplified version)

### 5. Building System ✅ COMPLETED (Logic)
- **Road Construction** ✅
  - ✅ Cost: 1 Wood + 1 Clay
  - ✅ Must connect to existing roads or settlements
  - ✅ Validate adjacency rules
  
- **Settlement Construction** ✅
  - ✅ Cost: 1 Wood + 1 Clay + 1 Grain + 1 Wool
  - ✅ Only on free nodes
  - ✅ Minimum 2-node distance from other settlements
  - ✅ Awards 1 victory point
  
- **City Upgrade** ✅
  - ✅ Cost: 2 Grain + 3 Ore
  - ✅ Only on existing own settlements
  - ✅ Replace settlement with city
  - ✅ Awards 2 victory points (total, not additional)

### 6. Victory Conditions ✅ COMPLETED
- **Win Condition Tracking** ✅
  - ✅ Target: 10 victory points
  - ✅ Points from settlements: 1 point each
  - ✅ Points from cities: 2 points each
  - ❌ Optional: Longest road (2 points for 5+ connected roads) - Not implemented
  - ✅ Immediate game end when 10 points reached

### 7. Game Flow Management ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- **Turn-Based System** ⚠️
  - ❌ Dice roll phase - Needs UI integration
  - ❌ Resource production phase - Needs UI integration
  - ❌ Building action phase - Needs UI integration
  - ✅ Turn transition
  - ✅ Game state validation

### 8. User Interface Design ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- **Game Screen Components** ⚠️
  - ✅ Hexagonal game board visualization
  - ✅ Game legend showing terrain types, player colors, dice numbers, and building costs
  - ❌ Player information panels - Basic structure exists, needs content
  - ❌ Resource counters - Not implemented
  - ❌ Building placement interface - Not implemented
  - ❌ Turn indicator - Not implemented
  - ❌ Victory point display - Not implemented
  
- **Start Screen** ⚠️
  - ✅ Basic structure exists
  - ❌ Player setup (3-4 players) - Not implemented
  - ❌ Name and color selection - Not implemented
  - ❌ Game initialization - Not implemented
  
- **Settings Screen** ⚠️
  - ✅ Basic structure exists
  - ❌ Game options - Placeholder only
  - ❌ Display preferences - Placeholder only

### 9. Game Initialization ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- **Setup Phase** ⚠️
  - ✅ Random board generation
  - ✅ Initial robber placement
  - ✅ Player order determination
  - ❌ Starting resources (if any) - Not implemented

### 10. Input Validation ✅ COMPLETED (Logic)
- **Rule Enforcement** ✅
  - ✅ Building placement validation
  - ✅ Resource requirement checking
  - ✅ Legal move verification
  - ✅ Turn action limitations

## Excluded Features (As Per Requirements)
- ❌ Development cards
- ❌ Special cards (Largest Army, etc.)
- ❌ Expansions (Cities & Knights, etc.)
- ❌ Network functionality
- ❌ AI opponents
- ❌ Animations, music, sound effects
- ❌ Resource card stealing from robber
- ❌ Maritime trade

## Optional Features
- ✅ Trading between players (simple implementation)
- ✅ Longest road calculation
- ⚠️ Square fields instead of hexagons (7-point penalty)

## Implementation Priority Order

### Phase 1: Core Structure ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ Game board representation (Hexagon, GameField)
2. ✅ Player class with resources and buildings
3. ✅ Basic UI framework (JavaFX screens)

### Phase 2: Game Mechanics ⚠️ PARTIALLY COMPLETED
1. ⚠️ Dice rolling and resource production - Logic exists, needs UI integration
2. ✅ Building placement system
3. ✅ Victory point calculation
4. ✅ Turn management

### Phase 3: Advanced Features ⚠️ PARTIALLY COMPLETED
1. ✅ Robber mechanics
2. ✅ Building rule validation
3. ❌ Game initialization and setup - Needs UI implementation
4. ✅ Win condition detection

### Phase 4: Polish ❌ NOT STARTED
1. ❌ UI improvements
2. ❌ Input validation
3. ❌ Error handling
4. ❌ Testing and debugging

## Technical Architecture
- **MVC Pattern**: Separate game logic from UI
- **Modular Design**: Each component in separate packages
- **Event-Driven**: UI responds to game state changes
- **Extensible**: Design allows for future feature additions

## Quality Assurance
- **Stability**: Robust error handling and input validation
- **Usability**: Intuitive interface design
- **Maintainability**: Clean code structure and documentation
- **Reliability**: Consistent game rule enforcement
